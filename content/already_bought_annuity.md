# If you’ve already bought an annuity

Annuity rules will change in 2017. You may then be able to sell an existing annuity and use the money to get a lump sum or an [adjustable income](/adjustable-income).

Under current rules, once you’ve bought an annuity you can’t change the decision.

An annuity provides a guaranteed income for a fixed number of years or the rest of your life. Before deciding to sell, you’ll need to find how much you could get for your annuity and if it would be worth selling. You’ll also need to consider the loss of that regular income.

The rules on selling an annuity may mean that you’ll have to speak to a [financial adviser](/financial-advice) before you’re able to sell.

%Pension Wise will offer guidance on selling an annuity when the new rules come in.%

## How much you’ll get for your annuity

How much money you’ll get from selling an annuity is likely to be based, for example, on:

  * your age now and when you bought the annuity
  * the type of annuity, eg single life, joint life
  * your health and lifestyle
  * how much you currently receive from your annuity

Money you get from selling an annuity will be treated as income and is taxable. You'll need to take this into account when deciding whether to sell your annuity.
